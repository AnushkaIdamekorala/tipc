TBDs
- search the code for TODO and TBD comments and resolve them

Coverage
- ensure that we get consistent coverage information
  * it seems to fluctuate
- fix system tests which fail now because bootstrap doesn't define TIPCLANG
- ensure travis ships results to codecov
- develop targetted tests to achieve 100% non-internal-error stmt coverage
  * if we can't force errors those errors

Testing
- unit testing is done 
- system testing is done 

Design
- incorporate all semantic analysis into a single phase with multiple passes

Code Gen Upgrade
- maintain philosophy of assuming type correctness and generating code appropriately
- for records, always generate code for uber record
  - fixed layout of fields, all fields hold Int64
  - default initialize using calloc

Documentation
- look into generating doxygen
- document each class in doxygen style
- host on github pages

Update README.md
- bootstrap and platforms supported
- discuss design, test, etc. 
- links to doxygen
