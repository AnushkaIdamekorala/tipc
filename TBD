Coverage
- ensure that we get consistent coverage information
  * it seems to fluctuate
- develop targetted tests to achieve 100% non-internal-error stmt coverage
  * if we can't force errors those errors

Testing
- extend pretty printer tests since they are used to test the builder
  - small fragments that 
- design APIs for type checking to support unit testing

Design
- do we want all nodes to record a link to their parent in the AST?
  * this would help with AST transformation
- think about how to better integrate symbol table into other phases
  * type checking
  * code generation (now we don't even use it)

Record Code gen
- integrate into current version
- identify exactly where type checking is needed and how it will be integrated
  * to ease future work

sipc

- update grammar
- extend parser unit tests

- update AST, AST builder and pretty printer
  * support for natively in the AST 
  * introduce a desugaring pass that will replace them with assigns/whiles
    - this will be a visitor that will move the children to the new structure
    - must visit declaration statement to add those variables
    - replace for with a BlockStatement
    - how do we hook into the For's parent
- extend pretty print tests
  * note that the pretty printer will not recover for loops for desuragared ASTs

- test symbol table to see whether it needs any updates
