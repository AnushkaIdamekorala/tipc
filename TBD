TBDs
- search the code for TODO and TBD comments and resolve them
- logging

Testing
- front end test that uses output streaming for all node types
- substituter code may be unreachable, i.e., substitutions by
  definition don't have vars, mu's never need substituting?
- TipMu is uncovered - this is not possible due to the polymorphic tests
  build it as a unit test?
- how can CheckAssignable.cpp be covered and not the .h file
- drop print routine from UnionFind
