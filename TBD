TBDs
- search the code for TODO and TBD comments and resolve them

Testing
- substituter code may be unreachable, i.e., substitutions by
  definition don't have vars, mu's never need substituting?
- TipMu is uncovered - I thought that the polymorphic tests hit it as a unit test?
- Why is TipMu in TypeVars?  Did I mean TipAlpha or should it just be TipVar?
- Unit test to trigger the final Unification error in Unifier.cpp
